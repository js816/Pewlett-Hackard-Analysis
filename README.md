# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to partner with Pewlett-Hackard human resources to proactively identify the potential impact of an upcoming wave of employees who will be eligible for retirement.  Additionally, the analysis looks at the next wave of key employees who will be taking the reins in vital positions within the organization and identifying those who would be candidates for a mentoring program to lead into the future. 


# Results

## Significant number of employees will likely be retiring soon

Of PH’s 240,124 current employees, 90,398 (37.6%) meet the criteria identified as candidates for retirement.  These criteria were employees born between 1952 and 1955 and hired by the company between 1985 and 1988.  It is clear that proactive steps need to be taken by company leadership to ensure that future generations of key employees are coming up to speed to continue to lead into the future.

## Many engineers nearing retirement

When looking specifically at the engineering roles, roles that are particularly vital to success and that have a steep learning curve, over 45,000 employees will soon likely be retiring.  The 45,397 assistant engineers, engineers, and senior engineers who met the retirement criteria account for 37.7% of all engineers within the organization.  It is evident that such a large portion of key employees approaching retirement is something that, without strategic response, could significantly impact future innovation and growth of the brand.

When looking at each individual title, of the senior engineers, 34.2% are approaching retirement.  For engineers, the portion is 45.9%.  Assistant engineers are highest at 49.1%.

Because of the high portion of these employees approaching retirement, the key role they play within the organization, and the learning curve in the environment, it is likely this area should be a key initial focus.

## Nearly half in staff positions approaching retirement

Another key title to closely examine is the role of staff.  While the learning curve may be less, nearly half, 48.0%, of those in a staff position are approaching retirement.  

Senior staff positions are impacted to a lesser degree with 34.4% meeting the criteria.


## On going project

Given the very large number of employees meeting the criteria identified, it is suggested that this project be continued on an on-going basis.  The data make it clear that this is not a one-time, temporary effort, but something that will likely continue on for the next several years and could be key to the organization’s continued growth and success.

Further suggested for queries to help ensure success will be provided below.


# Summary

Assuming that workforce needs will remain steady into the future, the organization will need to hire more than 90,000 employees to replace those who will soon be retiring.  The positions to be filled run the gamut across all titles.

Another portion of this analysis was to examine how many employees could be prime candidates for a mentorship program.  To identify those who are candidates.  That criterion provided by human resources was employees born in 1965.  The results show that 1,549 employees fell in that category.  This number is only 1.7% of the number of those approaching retirement.  It is evident that other solutions are needed.


## Additional insights

In order to ensure the continued success of the organization, there are some other queries that could be developed to provide additional insight.

First, it is suggested that the count and percentage of employees approaching retirement be examined on a per title and per department basis.  This can help identify if there are specific titles within specific departments where efforts can initially be focused or if the impact will be felt equally across the board.

Additionally, it might make sense to evaluate the impact across various geographic sites within the company.  Given the current leaning toward virtual work, this may be less important.  However, if there are certain sites or countries that have significant portions of their employees approaching retirement, this may provide greater insight for decisions regarding those locations.

Finally, as the queries performed for this analysis and others are refined, it might make sense to automate these processes for company leaders to be able to access the data at their convenience to allow for tracking of trends as various solutions are implemented.
